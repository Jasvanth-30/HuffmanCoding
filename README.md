# Huffman Coding in Java

This is a simple and clean implementation of the **Huffman Coding** algorithm in Java. Huffman Coding is a greedy algorithm used for **lossless data compression**.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- Calculates frequency of characters in the input string
- Builds Huffman Tree using Java's `PriorityQueue`
- Creates encoding and decoding maps
- Supports encoding any string to binary
- Decodes binary string back to original
